# Android

Download the APK file here:
[Click to Download](/IF_ASC_v1.3.apk).

You may need to enable `Install from unknown sources` or something similar to install.

After installation, close and relaunch the app twice to get the latest update.

Please take a look at [Don't Kill My App](https://dontkillmyapp.com/) and follow the instructions applicable to your device. This is because Android likes to kill background tasks to save battery life, which can prevent IF-ASC from working.

~~If you are using Android 13 or above, remember to enable notification permission for this app. Otherwise you will not be able to see any notifications sent by the app.~~ Not required in `v1.3.0` and up.

# iOS
