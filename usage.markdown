This page covers how to use IF-AutoStepClimb, and goes into detail the concepts and features it has.

# Glossary

- **IF-ASC** = Infinite Flight Auto Step Climb.
- **Minimum Activation Altitude** = the altitude the aircraft must be in order for IF-ASC to automatically get to work.
- **TOC** = Top of Climb

<h2 id="quick-start">Quick Start.</h2>
_Assuming you have followed the installation steps._
 1. Open Infinite Flight and enter a flight session.
 2. File a flightplan, with waypoints with altitudes assigned to them saying what altitude do you wish to be when you get there.
 3. Launch and activate AutoStepClimb. This will connect to your IF client and do its initialisation. You will get a notification when this is complete.
 4. After takeoff, AutoStepClimb will automatically get working when:  
  a) on the autopilot, SPD, LNAV, VS and ALT is engaged.  
  b) you reach the  _Minimum Activation Altitude_. By default, it is set to 10,000ft MSL , but this can be changed in the settings.
5. After that, watch AutoStepClimb do its thing!
6. One thing to note is that if a descent is needed, such as when you have reached your TOC, IF-ASC will automatically deactivate and notify you advising you to use VNAV.
