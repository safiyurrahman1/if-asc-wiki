# IF Auto Step Climb for Android

## Introduction

After about two weeks of losing braincells, I introduce you to Auto Step Climb for Android - a bare-bones, simple application that automates the process of step-climbing. And what's more? **It's free and open source!** (dont roast my code too much its my first mobile development project)

## So, what is it?

Auto Step Climb is a third-party application that uses the Infinite Flight Connect API to automate the whole process of step-climbing. **It is still advisable that you remain with your device during climb**, but this will help make this a little less hassle, especially those doing long-haul overnight flights.

## Backstory

I was quite curious in the Connect API and so I decided to experiment with it, after coming from web development which gave me enough understanding in how the API works. In addition, since IF-Assistant did not have this feature for Android, I thought why not make my own?

## Installation

1. Go to the [download page](/download) and download the APK file.
2. Install it on your device. You may need to enable `Install from unknown sources` or something similar.

The reason for this is, due to me being under 18, I am unable to publish this application on the Google Play Store.

## How it works.

See the [Quick Start Guide](/usage#quick-start) for this.

## Thanks

- @likeablegeek for the Connect API client that I used, [ifc2](https://github.com/likeablegeek/ifc2). Absolute life-saver üôè
- My girlfriend for emotional support, after countless hours of debugging.
- Jan for extensive feedback findings that make IF-ASC less prone to bugs, and suggestions that will make its way into IF-ASC in future updates
